      <description>The following writeup is a my analysis of the Hells Gate malware. This malware strain contains a technique that performs syscalls on the Windows operating system in order to evade EDR detection.&#xA;Upon completion of my analysis, I developed my own implementation in C++ that uses existing syscall instructions within ntdll.dll and a custom hashing technique to evade the modern methods of detection for these types of techniques.&#xA;There are further optimizations that can be added to the technique, however for the sake of time, two PoC&amp;rsquo;s were developed.</description>
